          This artistic piece combines portrait photography and sports imagery in a 
          minimalist black and white style.

          The design features Arsenal star Bukayo Saka in two contrasting poses - a formal 
          portrait with a signature pose and a celebratory moment from a match. The composition 
          is enhanced with his signature, the Nigerian flag, and the Arsenal crest, creating a 
          powerful visual narrative that celebrates both his heritage and his club identity.
