        <p>
          For reasons still unclear, Chess.com has started blocking all requests to their API 
          originating from DigitalOcean IP addresses (
          <a 
            href="https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/chess-com-api-returns-403-blocked-by-cloudflare" 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            className="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800"
          >
            source
          </a>
          ). Unfortunately, that's where I host all my backend infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than go through the hassle of migrating everything to a new provider, 
          setting up SSH keys, redeploying containers, and all that chaos, I decided to 
          get creative. The solution? A lightweight "proxy" API, deployed using serverless 
          functions on Vercel.
        </p>
      </TextBlock>

      <TextBlock title="Design and Architecture" color="blue">
        <p>
          At its core, this project is a simple wrapper around the Chess.com API. 
          It pulls data from their endpoints and repackages it to better suit the needs 
          of my Three.js backend server and my chess analytics system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each route is built as a serverless function and automatically deployed by Vercel 
          under my hobby plan. This setup gives me a clean set of endpoints that I can 
          reuse across all my chess-related projects, without having to worry about the 
          original IP blocks.
        </p>
      </TextBlock>

      <TextBlock title="Impact" color="green">
        <p>
          This solution has been incredibly effective. Not only did it solve the immediate 
          problem of accessing Chess.com data, but it also created a more maintainable 
          and scalable architecture for all my chess-related projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because each endpoint is modular and self-contained, I can easily reuse or update 
          them across different projects, whether it's for visualizations, analysis, or future tools. 
          And with everything deployed serverlessly, there's zero overhead in maintaining the infrastructure.
